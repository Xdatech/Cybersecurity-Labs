# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Labs README

## 🔥 Overview
Welcome to my **Cybersecurity Labs Repository**! This repository serves as a collection of hands-on security projects, research, and exercises focused on **Red Teaming, Blue Teaming, and Advanced Threat Intelligence**. This will document my journey in **SOC operations, penetration testing, incident response, and cybersecurity automation** as I work towards mastery in offensive and defensive security.

## 🚀 Labs & Projects
Below is a structured breakdown of the labs and projects I am working on:

### 🏴‍☠️ Red Team Labs
- **Penetration Testing Playbooks** – Collection of pentesting methodologies, tactics, and custom scripts.
- **Exploitation Labs** – Vulnerability discovery, buffer overflows, privilege escalation, and post-exploitation techniques.
- **Active Directory Attacks** – Hands-on labs for Kerberoasting, Pass-the-Hash, Golden Ticket attacks, etc.
- **Web Application Hacking** – SQL Injection, XSS, SSRF, RCE, and more.
- **Wireless & IoT Hacking** – Wi-Fi cracking, Bluetooth attacks, and IoT exploitation.

### 🔵 Blue Team Labs
- **SOC Analysis & Threat Hunting** – SIEM (Splunk, ELK, Wazuh) detections, correlation rules, and incident response.
- **Log Analysis & Forensics** – Investigating attack patterns and creating advanced detection rules.
- **Malware Analysis** – Reverse engineering and dynamic/static malware analysis.
- **Memory Forensics** – Analyzing RAM dumps for attacker footprints.
- **Cloud Security** – Investigating AWS, Azure, and GCP security threats.

### 🤖 Cybersecurity Automation & AI Integration
- **Python for Security** – Custom scripts for automation, SIEM log parsing, and security tooling.
- **AI-Powered SOC Tools** – Exploring how AI can be used for threat detection and response.
- **Automated Exploit Development** – Using ML/AI to analyze vulnerabilities.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Offensive Security**: Kali Linux, Metasploit, Cobalt Strike, BloodHound, Empire, Burp Suite, etc.
- **Defensive Security**: Splunk, ELK, Zeek, Security Onion, OSSEC, Wazuh, etc.
- **Programming & Scripting**: Python, Bash, PowerShell, C, Assembly.
- **Cloud & Container Security**: AWS Security, Kubernetes, Docker security analysis.
- **Forensics & Reverse Engineering**: Autopsy, Volatility, IDA Pro, Ghidra.
